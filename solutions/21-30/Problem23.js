// Problem 23
//
// This problem was asked by Google.
//
// You are given an M by N matrix consisting of booleans that represents a board.
// Each True boolean represents a wall. Each False boolean represents a tile you can walk on.
//
// Given this matrix, a start coordinate, and an end coordinate, return the minimum number of steps required to reach the end coordinate from the start.
// If there is no possible path, then return null. You can move up, left, down, and right. You cannot move through walls. You cannot wrap around the edges of the board.
//
// For example, given the following board:
//
// [[0, 0, 0, 0],
// [1, 1, 0, 1],
// [0, 0, 0, 0],
// [0, 0, 0, 0]]
// and start = (3, 0) (bottom left) and end = (0, 0) (top left)
// the minimum number of steps required to reach the end is 7, since we would need to go through (1, 2) because there is a wall everywhere else on the second row.
//
// O(MN) Time and Space Complexity
// M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns

// perform bfs with matrix
