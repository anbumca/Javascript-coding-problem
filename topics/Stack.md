# Stack

## Problem 43

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Implement a stack that has the following methods:

- push(val), which pushes an element onto the stack
- pop(), which pops off and returns the topmost element of the stack. If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.
- max(), which returns the maximum value in the stack currently. If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.

Each method should run in constant time.

## Problem 53

This problem was asked by Apple.

Implement a queue using two stacks. Recall that a queue is a FIFO (first-in, first-out) data structure with the following methods: enqueue, which inserts an element into the queue, and dequeue, which removes it.
